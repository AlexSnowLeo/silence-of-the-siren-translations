Even C-class citizens must have the freedom to spend their leisure time drunk like a fish. The UNSS is about freedom ... and about regulation of that freedom. If your drinking does not endanger my drinking, we are just two harmless free-time drunks and everything is fine. </Text>  </GameDBLocalizedString>

Regrettably, the Siren System is full of atmospheric distortion and ancient jammers, so all that surveillance gear we brought from the Solar System refuses to work. But the UNSS contracts inventive people, we will figure something out.</Text>  </GameDBLocalizedString>

Easy to build, impossible to replicate. Without this precaution, the Fossorians and Sovereigns would already be dancing on our graves. </Text>  </GameDBLocalizedString>

Exclusively, because humans never pass the entrance exams. It's not that humans aren't that smart, but ... Heh, to hell with political correctness. Hesperidians are way smarter. It's what it is. </Text>  </GameDBLocalizedString>

We obtained them as a gift from the Hesperidians and we were not ready. Maybe that's why they took over so many leadership roles. Hesperidian technology created a world much more suited for them than for us. </Text>  </GameDBLocalizedString>

No wonder. It was in a sorry state after centuries in space. How they survived the last 50 years on a single remaining species of edible hydroponic weed is a testament to their skills and dedication. </Text>  </GameDBLocalizedString>

They kept the same open-minded approach even in the Siren System when exploring the ancient Primals technology, often pushing our definition of paranormal. </Text>  </GameDBLocalizedString>

Weapons and gear evolved to suit those needs, therefore the early clashes with other factions of the Siren System were quite "educational" experiences. </Text>  </GameDBLocalizedString>

Plastic that is surprisingly conductive, so when you touch the Volt case, you get punched so hard your butt cheeks make a clapping noise? No?

First, it's cheaper to produce a new piece than repair a broken one. Second, getting rid of a broken piece is a bureaucratic nightmare.

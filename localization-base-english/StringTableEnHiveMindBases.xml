All the knowledge of the tribe's previous generations is preserved and ready to be passed to those who seek it.   </Text>  </GameDBLocalizedString>
            <GameDBLocalizedString>         <LocID>BUILDING_HIVEMIND_REMOTE_LEARNING_LORE</LocID>              <Text>Tumori can instantly learn complex skills and knowledge coded in the memory tissue, delivered by individuals between swarms. Yeah, baby, like in the Matrix! Though directed by David Cronenberg. But you can still say "I know kung fu" in the end, so does it really matter?</Text>  </GameDBLocalizedString>

            <GameDBLocalizedString>         <LocID>BUILDING_HIVEMIND_FACULTY_SPECIALIZATION_LORE</LocID>       <Text>Each swarm consists of many kinds of specialised individuals. The percentage is dependent on its current needs. The Ancestral Swarm stores knowledge; therefore, there is barely any space for anything else than memory-bearing individuals. In short: big brain, no sense of humor. </Text>  </GameDBLocalizedString>

            <GameDBLocalizedString>         <LocID>BUILDING_HIVEMIND_FACULTY_EXPLORE_LORE</LocID>              <Text>It is a burden to inherit the world from a civilization so advanced that your most high-tech stuff looks like a baking soda volcano standing next to a nuclear submarine. Yet, Tumori are no quitters. They are always searching for another lost digsite to deepen their understanding of the technology of Primals. </Text>  </GameDBLocalizedString>

            <GameDBLocalizedString>         <LocID>BUILDING_HIVEMIND_FACULTY_TECH_LORE</LocID>                 <Text>Almost all Outworlders are aggressive aliens and do not wish for peaceful coexistence. BUT! They have technology. Although it lacks the grace natural to biological structures, it is pretty useful, therefore worth stealing. </Text>  </GameDBLocalizedString>

            <GameDBLocalizedString>         <LocID>BUILDING_HIVEMIND_FACULTY_BIO_LORE</LocID>                  <Text>Biotechnology, the pride and joy of all Tumori. In their hands, it can actually jerry-rig some of the ancient Primal machines. All other factions must be green with envy over this! </Text>  </GameDBLocalizedString>
            <GameDBLocalizedString>         <LocID>BUILDING_HIVEMIND_FACULTY_PSY_LORE</LocID>                  <Text>Tumori tribesmen have always been hungry for the mind-influencing "magic" manifested by Primal artifacts. Eventually, the Shamans studying their strange effects were able to decipher and simplify some of the principles enough to be mimicked.    </Text>  </GameDBLocalizedString>

            <GameDBLocalizedString>         <LocID>BUILDING_HIVEMIND_DEFENSIVE_CORE_LORE</LocID>               <Text>Tumori have inherited some of the mighty weaponry of the old world - technology so advanced it gets mistaken for magic. Only thanks to these "magic weapons", they were able to survive the genocidal crusades launched by the Children of the Source. </Text>  </GameDBLocalizedString>
            <GameDBLocalizedString>         <LocID>BUILDING_HIVEMIND_DEFENSIVE_TOWER_LORE</LocID>              <Text>Some of the "magic weapons" inherited from Primals were lost in wars, and some lost their abilities due to aging without proper maintenance. Approaching modern times, Tumori have to rely more and more on their own technology.     </Text>  </GameDBLocalizedString>
            <GameDBLocalizedString>         <LocID>BUILDING_HIVEMIND_DEFENSIVE_MINES_LORE</LocID>              <Text>You don't need to understand the technology to use it, and that's doubly true when it comes to weapons. At first, the Rogue Traffickers were reluctant to deal with arms, but when they learned the Tumori pay in Primal artifacts, they overcame their moral dilemma with surprising ease.  </Text>  </GameDBLocalizedString>

            <GameDBLocalizedString>         <LocID>BUILDING_HIVEMIND_DEFENSIVE_TURRET_LORE</LocID>             <Text>There is no way to reprogram these cheap UNSS turrets to recognize a wide variety of hosts used by the Tumori. Instead, turrets are operated by swarms so old that they can barely hold consciousness. There are incidents, yes, but it's way better than all other options. </Text>  </GameDBLocalizedString>


            <GameDBLocalizedString>         <LocID>BUILDING_HIVEMIND_DISASSEMBLER_LORE</LocID>                 <Text>The carnivorous Fugor mycelium is not "picky"; any living tissue will suffice. At first, it's not pretty nor silent, but as the digestion progresses, the movement becomes scarce and the noises get suppressed.   </Text>  </GameDBLocalizedString>


            <GameDBLocalizedString>         <LocID>BUILDING_HIVEMIND_SPAWNER_1_LORE</LocID>                    <Text>Young swarms compulsively seek their first host even before they form a consciousness. The Fungor mycelium produces atractants to help them find their first home. Still less moldy than the first place I could rent. Nah, I am joking, I am ... please, give me a moment. </Text>  </GameDBLocalizedString>
            <GameDBLocalizedString>         <LocID>BUILDING_HIVEMIND_SPAWNER_1_UPG_LORE</LocID>                <Text>As the swarm grows, it develops its consciousness, but without knowledge, it is still "hollow". Then, an older swarm sends its individuals packed with memory tissue ... and that's it. Congratulations, you have reached maturity!      </Text>  </GameDBLocalizedString>

            <GameDBLocalizedString>         <LocID>BUILDING_HIVEMIND_SPAWNER_2_LORE</LocID>                    <Text>They cannot simply say, "Just catch a little Baloo and inoculate it with the crystal necessary for shooting beams of energy." No! There is the Ceremony of Conjunction, the Ritual of a Thousand Eyes, etc, till everyone is in the state of absolute higgledy-piggledy.  </Text>  </GameDBLocalizedString>
            <GameDBLocalizedString>         <LocID>BUILDING_HIVEMIND_SPAWNER_2_UPG_LORE</LocID>                <Text>The bigger the head, the bigger the crystal. The bigger the crystal, the stronger the beam ... till the moment the crystal overgrows the head and kills the host. Fortunately for the swarm, it means just a change of host. Being a parasite has its advantages.  </Text>  </GameDBLocalizedString>

            <GameDBLocalizedString>         <LocID>BUILDING_HIVEMIND_SPAWNER_3_LORE</LocID>                    <Text>The UNSS Research Division figured out how to copy the metamorphosis mechanism. The only thing holding them back is the exponential growth of energy consumption whenever they want to prolong their Mimicking Tactics beyond a certain point. Surprise surprise, nature vs lab, 1:0.   </Text>  </GameDBLocalizedString>
            <GameDBLocalizedString>         <LocID>BUILDING_HIVEMIND_SPAWNER_3_UPG_LORE</LocID>                <Text>A living tissue can't mimic every single property of a reinforced steel plate. No matter what molecular-bullshit, sci-fi somersault you make, you will always land on your head. So, choose wisely what you turn into next, my mighty morphing friend!  </Text>  </GameDBLocalizedString>

But even a headshot will not save you against this creature with a dispersed nervous system and several independent ganglia centers ready to take over the "wheel". The Slugtor is the perfect bullet sponge. </Text>  </GameDBLocalizedString>

Under the Slugtor's soft skin, there is a layer of interlinked zirconium dioxide scales, giving the beast the toughness of a Special Forces guy from 80's action flicks.       </Text>  </GameDBLocalizedString>

            <GameDBLocalizedString>         <LocID>BUILDING_HIVEMIND_SPAWNER_5_LORE</LocID>                    <Text>Yeah, teleportation is a great idea until you take a trip with, I don't know, for example, a fly in your pocket! "Something Went Wrong, Seth! When You Went Through, Something Went Wrong!"   </Text>  </GameDBLocalizedString>
            <GameDBLocalizedString>         <LocID>BUILDING_HIVEMIND_SPAWNER_5_UPG_LORE</LocID>                <Text>During the first days of exploration, Michael Moore 3C and his troops encountered a Malarion. "Pardon my language," said the Hesperidian, "the incidence of such a huge fly gives us all the information about the depth of sh*t we are currently stepping in. Gents, on count of three, we run to the landing module. THREE!".  </Text>  </GameDBLocalizedString>

Then the UNSS released a dismissive disclaimer by a man in a white cloak, which calmed the crowds. I was calm too until I noticed the "hand-wash-only" icon on one of their loincloths. </Text>  </GameDBLocalizedString>
            <GameDBLocalizedString>         <LocID>BUILDING_HIVEMIND_SPAWNER_6_UPG_LORE</LocID>                <Text>Long-distance teleportation is a pain in the ... is a problem. You could think that only making short jumps would be much safer. Until I crossed a dead Skull Hunters whose lower half ended in a tree. It all stands and falls with good distance estimation.  </Text>  </GameDBLocalizedString>

But how exactly the Primals' society benefited from the presence of these carnivorous monsters is quite hard to imagine.    </Text>  </GameDBLocalizedString>

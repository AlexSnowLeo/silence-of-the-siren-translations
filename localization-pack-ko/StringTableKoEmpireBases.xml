Regrettably, the Siren System is full of atmospheric distortion and ancient jammers, so all that surveillance gear we brought from the Solar System refuses to work. But the UNSS contracts inventive people. We will figure something out.</Text>  </GameDBLocalizedString>

Learning drugs, hypnosis, electro-shocks, ... all are less "painful" than learning.

We obtained them as gifts from the Hesperidians and were not ready. Maybe that's why they took over so many leadership roles. Hesperidian technology created a world much more suited for them than for us. </Text>  </GameDBLocalizedString>

No wonder. It was in a sorry state after centuries in space. How they survived the last 50 years on a single remaining species of edible hydroponic weed is a testament to their skills and dedication. </Text>  </GameDBLocalizedString>

They kept the same open-minded approach even in the Siren System when exploring the ancient Primal technology, often redefining our definition of the paranormal. </Text>  </GameDBLocalizedString>

Weapons and gear evolved to suit those needs, so the early clashes with other factions of the Siren System were quite "educational." </Text>  </GameDBLocalizedString>

First, producing a new piece is cheaper than repairing a broken one. Second, getting rid of a broken piece is a bureaucratic nightmare.

So far, we have only discovered that they are deeply rooted in the Primals' underground energy system. Hey, science, you used to be useful, do you remember?!</Text></GameDBLocalizedString>

It's not clear how, why, or by whom it was brought here, but it's obvious this ferocious predator is prospering pretty well in its new home. Maybe too well.</Text></GameDBLocalizedString>

Right in front of you stands the observation tower, offering a stunning view of the surrounding landscape. The leaves on the trees are beginning to change into autumn hues, and if you gaze at the distant hills, you will feel your body relax and your mind unwind. The air is fresh, with a natural scent that enhances the experience even further. \nIf you decide to climb to the top, you'll be rewarded with panoramic views that you can enjoy with a hot cup of tea in hand. This moment of tranquility is the perfect way to recharge and take in the beauty of the surrounding nature.</Text>  </GameDBLocalizedString>

Honestly, I don't get why we even have something like that around. Everything here is about wellness, peace, and relaxation ... and then there's this. It wasn't even built by us. Why would anyone want to think about fighting when they're here to relax? \nThe tomb looks like a toy sword stuck in the ground, certainly not something that should be part of this peaceful environment.</Text>  </GameDBLocalizedString>

            <GameDBLocalizedString>         <LocID>MESSAGE_DOOM_OF_EDEN_ROSI_BEAST</LocID>                              <Text>Looking for something beyond relaxation and luxury?

How are you supposed to meditate when all you can hear is the constant clashing of metal?</Text>  </GameDBLocalizedString>
            <GameDBLocalizedString>         <LocID>MESSAGE_DOOM_OF_EDEN_ROSI_ROCKET</LocID>                             <Text>More space junk? Unbelievable. Imagine this, you take a group of noble intergalactic slugs on a peaceful stargazing retreat, and right at the spot where your gourmet food stand is set up, staffed by the only chef in the sector who knows how to prepare crystalline roe, a chunk of a crashed shuttle comes falling from the sky. Being a hotelier isn't easy...</Text>  </GameDBLocalizedString>
            <GameDBLocalizedString>         <LocID>MESSAGE_DOOM_OF_EDEN_ROSI_GATE</LocID>                               <Text>One of the four gates around here. We never found the keys, but we've tracked them circulating on the black market. Sooner or later, someone's going to show up with them, and I really can't be held responsible if they accidentally fall into the wood chipper.</Text>  </GameDBLocalizedString>

            <GameDBLocalizedString>         <LocID>MESSAGE_DOOM_OF_EDEN_ROSI_MOLLES_BASE</LocID>                        <Text>Here, we had a great idea that quickly fell apart a horror experience: stay in the enemy's environment. But relaxation and horror don't mix well ... my mistake. Feel free to take it over.</Text>  </GameDBLocalizedString>
            <GameDBLocalizedString>         <LocID>MESSAGE_DOOM_OF_EDEN_ROSI_PIRATES_BASE</LocID>                       <Text>This is my winter residence. I used to work for the "Sovereign," and I really love their architecture, it reminds me a lot of Gaudí. If you want, it's at your disposal, but don't you dare mess with my fossilized vegetable collection!</Text>  </GameDBLocalizedString>
            <GameDBLocalizedString>         <LocID>MESSAGE_DOOM_OF_EDEN_ROSI_FIREFLI</LocID>                            <Text>Stop! This is the only place in this area where fireflies appear. Usually, you'd find them in the mushroom region, but this is the only exception. It took me seven years to catch all the Luminovores. Did you know that in some areas, people catch, dry, and smoke them? ... you knew, didn't you? Don't even think about it!</Text>  </GameDBLocalizedString>
            <GameDBLocalizedString>         <LocID>MESSAGE_DOOM_OF_EDEN_ROSI_CRYSTAL</LocID>                            <Text>Do you see this beauty? This is the main attraction of our evening safari. At sunset, these magnificent lizards change form. Breathtaking, isn't it? But consider this a warning! If even a single crystal is missing or if they have the tiniest scratch, I'll turn you into an attraction, dress you up in a seal costume and throw you into a cage full of polar bears.</Text>  </GameDBLocalizedString>
            <GameDBLocalizedString>         <LocID>MESSAGE_DOOM_OF_EDEN_ROSI_MUSHROOM</LocID>                           <Text>Look, this is a magical mushroom. If you stay near it for a while, it will start to release spores that induce feelings of happiness and joy. Just be careful, we don't have an antidote yet.</Text>  </GameDBLocalizedString>

            <GameDBLocalizedString>         <LocID>MESSAGE_DOOM_OF_EDEN_ROSI_INTEL</LocID>                              <Text>We've received a message from the secret service – all the raiders have made a non-aggression pact, something along the lines of "first come, first served," which means they're only targeting. That's pretty bad news, I guess ... </Text>  </GameDBLocalizedString>

My life's work, ... well, my quarter-life's work is at risk. It’s possible that this place will soon be swarming with God knows what.\nWe need to prepare an army. I know I haven't been always very kind to you, but please, I beg you, help me protect this place.</Text>  </GameDBLocalizedString>

We can't waste any time, we need to start rebuilding the area. In a few phases, I'll send units to destroy the teleporters. Take out the remaining enemies and get some rest.
